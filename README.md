## Experience

### Siemens Technology and Services Pvt. Ltd., Bangalore, India

#### Research Engineer (2y)

Developed firmware for Graphics and Touch for a HMI unit for a boiler
control system application. The firmware used ARM's mbedOS RTOS and was
developed using the latest C++17 standard for an STM32 target. I
contributed by developing drivers for the touch screen and the LCD display,
both of which communicated with the MCU over SPI. I also created
automation, testing, and CI/CD tools using Python, gtest, and shell
scripts. The first version of the product was delivered in a short span
of 8 months

Led a team of 3 in designing a *soft-robot* in the 'Siemens
Innovathon'. The robot was actuated using three servo-motors which
communicated with a base station over I2C protocol. The prototype won the
*first position* in innovation category and was granted funding for
further development of mechanical design, improvements to electronics and
multi-body simulations

Developed a simulation toolbox for a high precision cobot with in
collaboration with international teams. The toolbox was developed using
MATLAB and Simulink for high fidelity dynamic simulation as well as HIL of
the robotic arm.

#### Intern (4.5m)

The undergraduation internship project included working extensively on ROS,
Gazebo for high fidelity simulations of robotic platforms, including open-chain
robots and aerial vehicles using Matlab and Simulink to create and evaluate
mathematical models using MBSE principles.

### Tata Sons - Group Technology & Innovation Office, Bangalore, India

#### Intern (1.5m)

Developed a UAV platform for precision agriculture applications involving
trajectory control, and SIL simulations using DroneKit python API. Performed
field tests algorithm evaluation.
